## Clinic Database/SQL
We have created a relational database from a clinic diagram.
All the information was inserted into 'clinic' database classified by:

- Patients
- Medical histories
- Treatments
- Invoices items
- Invoices

We have used PostgreSQL shell and pgAdmin4 to get a graphical view to sort and manage every data.

## Tools
PostgreSQL & pgAdmin 4


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema_based_on_diagram.sql) to create all tables.
