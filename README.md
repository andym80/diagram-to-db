## Clinic Database/SQL
We have created a relational database from a clinic diagram.
All the information was inserted into 'clinic' database classified by:

- Patients
- Medical histories
- Treatments
- Invoices items
- Invoices

We have used PostgreSQL shell and pgAdmin4 to get a graphical view to sort and manage every data.

## Tools
PostgreSQL & pgAdmin 4


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
